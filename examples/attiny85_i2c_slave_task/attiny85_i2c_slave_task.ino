/**
 * Example sketch for writing to and reading from a slave in transactional manner, it will also blink a led attached to pin 3 (which is the SOIC pin 2)
 * (provided you're using one of my ATTiny85 boards from https://github.com/rambo/attiny_boards with the led soldered) 
 *
 * NOTE: You must not use delay() or I2C communications will fail, use tws_delay() instead (or preferably some smarter timing system, like the Task library used in this example)
 *
 * On write the first byte received is considered the register addres to modify/read
 * On each byte sent or read the register address is incremented (and it will loop back to 0)
 *
 * You can try this with the Arduino I2C REPL sketch at https://github.com/rambo/I2C/blob/master/examples/i2crepl/i2crepl.ino 
 * If you have bus-pirate remember that the older revisions do not like the slave streching the clock, this leads to all sorts of weird behaviour
 *
 * By default this blinks the SOS morse pattern and then has long on/off time to indicate end of pattern, send [ 8 0 32 ] (using the REPL/bus-pirate 
 * semantics) to make the delay per bit smaller (and thus blinking faster). The pattern lenght is calculated from the register size, it would be fairly
 * trivial to make it yet another variable changeable via I2C.
 *
 * You need to have at least 8MHz clock on the ATTiny for this to work (and in fact I have so far tested it only on ATTiny85 @8MHz using internal oscillator)
 * Remember to "Burn bootloader" to make sure your chip is in correct mode

 *
 * DIP and SOIC have same pinout, however the SOIC chips are much cheaper, especially if you buy more than 5 at a time
 * For nice breakout boards see https://github.com/rambo/attiny_boards
 *
 * Basically the arduino pin numbers map directly to the PORTB bit numbers.
