/**
 * Example sketch for writing to and reading from a slave in transactional manner
 *
 * NOTE: You must not use delay() or I2C communications will fail, use tws_delay() instead (or preferably some smarter timing system)
 *
 * On write the first byte received is considered the register addres to modify/read
 * On each byte sent or read the register address is incremented (and it will loop back to 0)
 *
 * You can try this with the Arduino I2C REPL sketch at https://github.com/rambo/I2C/blob/master/examples/i2crepl/i2crepl.ino 
 * If you have bus-pirate remember that the older revisions do not like the slave streching the clock, this leads to all sorts of weird behaviour
 *
 * To read third value (register number 2 since counting starts at 0) send "[ 8 2 [ 9 r ]", value read should be 0xBE
 * If you then send "[ 9 r r r ]" you should get 0xEF 0xDE 0xAD as response (demonstrating the register counter looping back to zero)
 *
 * You need to have at least 8MHz clock on the ATTiny for this to work (and in fact I have so far tested it only on ATTiny85 @8MHz using internal oscillator)
 * Remember to "Burn bootloader" to make sure your chip is in correct mode

/**
 * Pin notes by Suovula, see also http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1229
 *
 * DIP and SOIC have same pinout, however the SOIC chips are much cheaper, especially if you buy more than 5 at a time
 * For nice breakout boards see https://github.com/rambo/attiny_boards
 *
 * Basically the arduino pin numbers map directly to the PORTB bit numbers.
